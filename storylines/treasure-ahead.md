# Treasure ahead

When raiding a colonial villa, a tribe chief finds a token he recognizes from a northern legend. The token appears to be a piece of a tremendous treasure buried in perpetual ice. He gathers a party and they sign on a trade mission to the north. Shortly before arrival, his party takes over the command of the ships and the search begins.
