# This valley is ours now
After fleeing from the ravaging hordes from the south, the northern folk arrived in a broad valley with fertile soil, well framed by high mountains. They left guards by the sea and travelled upwards to the spring of the river and build a strong fort, easy to defend from the high ground and surrounding hillsides. After the fort has proven to be effective protection against the pursuing southerners, the fort was expanded to a strong fortress, outposts were connected with bridges to the main fortress and later the city of five towers was built on this base.
