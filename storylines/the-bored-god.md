# The bored god
A bored god descends to earth to find inspiration. The scattered human settlements he finds are very disappointing to him, as all inhabitants are busy fighting for survival in their hostile environment. The god then climbed the mountains and built a temple, far from any peril, filled with plenty of food and music. He invites the folks to live in his temple and inspire him. After enjoying the feast for some time, the humans grew greedy and discontent despite everything they were offered. This angried the god so much, he turned all things inside his temple into solid gold and buried the temple in ice.
