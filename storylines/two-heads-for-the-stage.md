# Two heads for the stage
Born with two heads on one body, this boy was left behind by his parents at a foster home. He was taken care of, but looked at by the others as alien abomination, was often made fun of and endured a hard childhood. A circus visiting the city noticed the boy in the crowd and bought him for their freak show. After making the acquaintance of the circus wizard, a master of technical wonders and illusions, the boy quickly learned to engineer more and more complex machinery and tricks. After years as engineer on stage, he left the circus and went to university at Quintur Roy. Quickly it became clear, he had most advanced technical skills and after inventing a most clever fresh water and sewage system for the city, became the decan of the university. Inner twists and constant mobbing and slurs led to his suicide a few years later.
