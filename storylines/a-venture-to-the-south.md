# A venture to the south
A lone wolf explorer and trapper discovers a path leading to another world. He crosses the ice and ventures south. Following the river up a beautiful valley, he reaches a pass in the high mountains. He misjudges the ascend and nearly died of hypothermia, when the ground breaks beneath his feet and he falls into a golden temple, buried beneath the ice. The warmth still inherent to the inner chambers of the temple saves his live and after his recovery, he manages to cross the mountains to the south. In his pocket, a souvenir of his miraculous encounter, allthough no one is ever going to believe his story. South of the mountains he comes across a large trading city built on desert sand. From there he takes a ship back across the sea and lives his old days in a colonial villa in a warm, southern country.
