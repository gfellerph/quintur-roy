# Necessitys comrades
A boy, forced by the southern invaders to kill a hostage woman, flees the ships and stumbles upon a girl hiding in the ruins of a ransacked village. Not speeking each others language and living with the fear of getting murdered by each other, they come to an agreement that travelling together is more beneficial than struggling alone. They follow the caravan of refugees northwards, hoping to catch up, but are constantly set back by their mistrust in each other, lack of navigational and survival skills and psychological trauma suffered during the attacks. Eventually, they reach the bridge of ice, connecting two continents in winter, just before spring and manage to cross the crumbling path. With the southerners on their heels, they make sure the bridge is uncrossable and break the last connections on their way to safety, until next winter.
